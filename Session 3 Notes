Python is an OOPS- Object Oriented Programming
A class is the parameters that frame an object. 
For example, A= Vehicle(x,y)
The object A is of the vehicle class
Functions can also be put inside classes which give the objects behavior 
An example of a class would be Human, and the Object would be Mark, Mark is assigned values of the human class and can exhibit behavior of the human class
Re- Can be used to search through your code for stuff
Numpy- is a python library, can be used to make arrays/matrixes
You can do a variety of mathematical functions with numpy
Numpy will take random samples from a uniform distribution over the range 0-1
