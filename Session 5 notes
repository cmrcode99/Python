Day 5 Machine Learning Use Case
1.Find Your Target Output Column
2.Seperate X and Y
3.The do data preprocessing
4.Replace the NaN with the mean
5.Take Care of Strings/Categorical Values
6. for y column one hot encoding not necessary only x col in machine learning, except in deep learning
7. Then split the data into two sets- one training set and one test set
8. Then you feature scale(normalize the data)
9. Then you train, Training= Data+ Algo= Model
9. Supervised Ml- X and Y are know- There is Classification and Regression
Unsupervised- Only X is known â€“ Clustering
10. Look at the Data to figure out what type of regression you are doing, with many x values test different models to see which model has the best health.
